Multiplication Algorithm Homework

Assumptions:
- n and m will be referenced as the numbers being multiplied
- m is the bigger number

Steps:
1. Arrange the numbers in rows such that m is on the top row and n is on the bottom row.
2. Align the number's colunms (each digit) such that the right most digit of m
lines up with the right most digit of n (think justify right)
3. Starting with the right most column, for each digit in n (call it x) keep track of iterations in i (starting at 0):
    3b. Starting with the right most column, for each digit in m (call it y):
        3b1. perform x*y+(number above y if written) (product = z)
        3b2. if z >= 10 and y is not the left most digit of m:
            3b2a. write down the left most digit of z above the number to the left of y
            3b2b. set z = right most digit of z
        3b3. write down z in a new row at the bottom under x and y but indented i columns

4. for each digit written down under m and n starting from the right most column and going column by column:
    4a. add all digits in that column (rows with nothing written in that column count as zero for that row) (call it z)
    4b. if z >= 10 and you are not adding the left most column
        4b1. add 1 above the next column to the left
        4b2. z = right most digit of z
    4c. write down z in a new row in the column being added

5. Bottom row is the answer
